Let me summarize the issues we've been facing with the compress_legend function:

SITUATION: The compress_legend function is not properly grouping overweight, underweight and the different symbol traces as well as toggles are not working correctly.
I have made several iterations trying to fix these issues, but without success. 

CURRENT STATE: The most recent version of the function is not working for any of the legend items.

EXPECTATIONS:
Ensuring that both color-based and symbol-based groupings work simultaneously.
Implementing the double-click isolation feature without breaking the basic toggle functionality.
Maintaining the correct visibility states for all traces when toggling different legend items.

YOUR TASK IS TO RE-IMPLEMENT the compress_legend function so that the following can be achieved:

The legend should have separate entries for overweight (green) and underweight (purple).
It should also have entries for each bond maturity symbol (2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 20Y, 30Y).
Clicking on overweight or underweight should toggle all markers of that color, regardless of shape.
Clicking on a symbol (e.g., 2Y) should toggle all markers of that shape, regardless of color.
Double-clicking on any legend item should isolate that group, hiding all others.
